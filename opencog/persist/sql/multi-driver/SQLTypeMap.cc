/**
 * Store the concordance of type names to type values.
 *
 * The concordance is used to match up the type id's stored in
 * the SQL database, against those currently in use in the current
 * version of the opencog server. The basic problem is that types
 * can be dynamic in OpenCog -- different versions will have
 * different types, and will assign different type numbers to some
 * given type name. To overcome this, the SQL database stores all
 * atoms according to the type *name* -- although, to save space, it
 * actually stored type ids; however, the SQL type-name-to-type-id
 * mapping can be completely different than the OpenCog type-name
 * to type-id mapping. Thus, tables to convert the one to the other
 * id are needed.
 *
 * Given an opencog type t, the storing_typemap[t] will contain the
 * sqlid for the named type. The storing_typemap[t] will *always*
 * contain a valid value.
 *
 * Given an SQL type sq, the loading_typemap[sq] will contain the
 * opencog type t for the named type, or NOTYPE if this version of
 * opencog does not have this kind of atom.
 *
 * The typemaps must be constructed before any saving or loading of
 * atoms can happen. The typemaps will be a superset (union) of the
 * types used by OpenCog, and stored in the SQL table.
