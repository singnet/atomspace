	 * After substitution, remaining quotations might be useless or

	 * RewriteLink from hiding supposedly hidden variables, consume
	 * them.
	 *
	 * Specifically this code does the following
	 *
	 * 1. Remove needless quotations in front closed term, for instance
	 *
	 * (QuoteLink
	 *   (EvaluationLink
	 *     (Unquote (GroundedPredicate "gpn"))
	 *     (Unquote (Variable "$X"))))
	 *
	 * The Unquote in front of the "gpn" is useless so it removed,
	 * resulting into
	 *
	 * (QuoteLink
	 *   (EvaluationLink
	 *     (GroundedPredicate "gpn")
	 *     (Unquote (Variable "$X"))))
	 *
	 * 2. Remove obvious involutions such as
	 *
	 * (Quote
	 *   (Put
	 *     (Unquote (Quote (Lambda (Variable "$X") (Variable "$X"))))
	 *     (Concept "A")))
	 *
	 * (Unquote (Quote ... is an involution so remove it, resulting into
	 *
	 * (Quote
	 *   (Put
	 *     (Lambda (Variable "$X") (Variable "$X"))
	 *     (Concept "A")))
	 *
	 * Note that the root Quote cannot be removed otherwise it would
	 * change the semantics of the hypergraph (as the quotation
	 * prevents the PutLink from being executing).
	 *
	 * 3. Remove quotations around a fully substituted scope, for
	 * instance
	 *
	 * (Quote
	 *   (Lambda
	 *     (Unquote (TypedVariable (Variable "$X") (Type "ConceptNode")))
	 *     (Unquote (And (Concept "A") (Variable "$X")))))
	 *
	 * all quotations can be remove (in fact keeping them would be
	 * harmful because the variable $X would be interpreted as not
	 * being bound to this Lambda, to make sure it is should be bound
	 * to the lambda as opposed to be bound to a parent scope, a
	 * Variables object is passed in argument representing the
	 * variable declaration of that parent scope. Thus, assuming $X
	 * isn't in the variables object, the above would result into
	 *
	 * (Lambda
	 *   (TypedVariable (Variable "$X") (Type "ConceptNode"))
	 *   (And (Concept "A") (Variable "$X")))
