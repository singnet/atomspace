/**
 * Search for the next untried, (thus ungrounded, unsolved) clause.
 *
 * The "issued" set contains those clauses which are currently in play,
 * i.e. those for which a grounding is currently being explored. Both
 * grounded, and as-yet-ungrounded clauses may be in this set.  The
 * sole reason of this set is to avoid infinite recursion, i.e. of
 * re-identifying the same clause over and over as unsolved.
 *
 * The words "solved" and "grounded" are used as synonyms through out
 * the code.
 *
 * Additional complications are introduced by the presence of
 * evaluatable terms, black-box terms, and optional clauses. An
 * evaluatable term is any term that needs to be evaluated to determine
 * if it matches: such terms typically do not exist in the atomspace;
 * they are "virtual", and "exist" only when the evaluation returns
 * "true". Thus, these can only be grounded after all other possible
 * clauses are grounded; thus these are saved for last.  It is always
 * possible to save these for last, because earlier stages have
 * guaranteed that all of the non-virtual clauses are connected.
 * Anyway, evaluatables come in two forms: those that can be evaluated
 * quickly, and those that require a "black-box" evaluation of some
 * scheme or python code. Of the two, we save "black-box" for last.
 *
 * Then, after grounding all of the mandatory clauses (virtual or not),
 * we look for optional clauses, if any. Again, these might be virtual,
 * and they might be black...
 *
 * Thus, we use a helper function to broaden the search in each case.
