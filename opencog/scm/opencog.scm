; Main OpenCog guile module
;
; When this module is loaded from the guile prompt, it sets up all of
; the opencog infrastructure, including a default atomspace.
;
; To use, say this from the guile prompt:
; (use-modules (opencog))
;
;
; This should result in a utf8 locale being used!
; See https://github.com/opencog/opencog/issues/937
(setlocale LC_CTYPE "")
(setlocale LC_NUMERIC "C")

; libsmob won't be found unless we setenv where to find it!
; In theory, we should have installed it into one of these locations:
;    /usr/lib/guile/2.2/extensions
;    /usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/extensions
;    /usr/lib64/guile/2.2/extensions
;    /usr/local/lib64/guile/2.2/extensions
;
; But which one? Its a pain, so we wing it, below, and use
; LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH
;

; lib64 is used by various versions of CentOS
(define path "/usr/lib/opencog:/usr/lib64/opencog:/usr/local/lib/opencog:/usr/local/lib64/opencog")
(setenv "LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH"
	(if (getenv "LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH")
		(string-append (getenv "LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH") ":" path)
		path))

(define-module (opencog))
(load-extension "libsmob" "opencog_guile_init")

(use-modules (system base compile))

; Create a global to hold the atomspace ... to (try to) prevent guile
; GC from collecting it.  Unfortunately, there appears to be a GC bug
; in guile-2.1 that causes this to be collected, anyway.  Its as if
; guile forgets about this ... how? why? I don't get it.
;
; In various bad scenarios, the cogserver creates it's own atomspace,
; before the code here runs.  We want to avoid creating a second
; atomspace as a result. The below tries to avoid problems by simply
; grabbing the existing atomspace, if there already is one.
;
; FIXME: Both of the above-described problems might no longer exist.
; I'm not sure. The below is simple and painless, I'm leaving it for
; now.
