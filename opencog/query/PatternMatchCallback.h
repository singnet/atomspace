		 * An 'evaluatable term' is any pattern term (term occuring in the

		 * declared as 'evaluatable'.  The canonical, default convention
		 * is that evaluatable terms are any terms that contain a GPN --
		 * a 'GroundedPredicateNode', or are assorted relations, such
		 * as EqualLink, GreaterThanLink, etc.  Evaluatables may also be
		 * "connectives"; in the default canonical interpretation, these
		 * are AndLink, OrLink, NotLink, SequentialAnd and SequentialOr.
		 *
		 * The canonical interpretation is compiled in PatternLink. That
		 * is, PatternLink performs a static analysis of the pattern, and
		 * marks each term in the pattern as being evaluatable, or not.
		 * Other pattern compilers are free to choose other conventions;
		 * the pattern engine does not care.
		 *
		 * Unlike the other callbacks, this takes arguments in slightly
		 * different form.  Here, 'eval' is the evaluatable term, and
		 * 'gnds' contains the currently-proposed grounding for any
		 * variables occuring within that term. It is a map: the 'key' is
		 * either a variable, or another term whose grounding is being
		 * currently considered, and the 'value' is the proposed
		 * grounding.
		 *
		 * In ordinary logic, a well-formed formula with no free variables
		 * is called a "sentence". Thus, in the sense of logic, the 'eval'
		 * argument, together with 'gnds' combine to bind values to all
		 * the variables in 'term', thus leaving a sentence with no free
		 * variables. In logic, sentences are always true or false, ergo
		 * the the return value.
		 *
		 * The return value follows the same convention as all the other
		 * callbacks: 'true' accepts the grounding, and the search for the
		 * rest of the pattern continues, while 'false' rejects the
		 * grounding, and forces a backtrack.
