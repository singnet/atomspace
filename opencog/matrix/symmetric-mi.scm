  add-symmetric-mi-compute LLOBJ - Extend LLOBJ with methods to compute
  the symmetric mutual information from the symmetric matrices M^TM or
  MM^T, for M==LLOBJ a non-symmetric matrix.

  Some terminology: Let N(x,y) be the observed count for the pair (x,y).
  There are two ways of computing a dot-product: summing on the left,
  to get a dot-product of columns, or summing on the right, to get a
  product of rows.  Thus we define the left-product as
      left-prod(y,z) = sum_x N(x,y) N(x,z)
  where y and z are two different column indexes.  Likewise, the right
  product is
      right-prod(x,u) = sum_y N(x,y) N(u,y)
  with x and u being two different row indexes.

  The left-product is the same thing as an entry in the symmetric
  matrix M^TM (with M==LLOBJ and ^T the transpose). That is,
       left-product(y,z) = [M^TM](y,z)
  Likewise, the right-product is an entry in the matrix MM^T.

  These two symmtric matricies can be re-interpreted as pair-wise
  probabilities (frequencies) simply by normalizing by the total count.
  That is, if f(y,z) is a symmetric matrix, then
       p(y,z) = f(y,z) / f(*,*)
  can be interpreted as a (frequentist) probability. From this, one can
  construct the (fractional) mutual information:
       FMI(y,z) = log_2 p(y,z) / p(y) p(z)
  where p(y) = p(y,*) = p(*,y) is the marginal probability. The full MI
  is just of course
       MI(y,z) = p(y,z) FMI(y,z)

  Arguments:
  ----------
  Here, the LLOBJ is expected to be an object defining a sparse matrix,
  with valid counts associated with each pair. LLOBJ is expected to have
  working, functional methods for 'left-type, 'right-type and 'pair-type
  on it. It is assumed that the transpose-marginals on it have been
  previously computed, and are available in the atomspace.

  By default, the N(x,y) is taken to be the 'get-count method on LLOBJ,
  i.e. it is literally the count. The optional argument GET-CNT allows
  this to be over-ridden with any other method that returns a number.

  If 'get-count is over-ridden, then the cached transpose values too ...
